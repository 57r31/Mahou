# Mahou(魔法) - The magic Layout Switcher
### How it works
Mahou works completely different from other Layout Swithcer Programs, it switches *not by next layout*, but by **specified in settings** layouts. <br/>
Even selected text switches just between **selected** layouts, though if you liked cycling through locales starting from `v1.0.2.9` there is **Cycle Mode**.

### Features

1. To convert selection hit "Scroll" when select text
2. To convert input hit "Pause/Break" when typing

###### What it can do:
1. Convert last input to another of selected in settings locales.
2. Convert selected text to another of selected in settings locales.
