# Mahou(魔法) - The magic Layout Switcher
### How it works
Mahou works completely different from other Layout Swtichers, it switches *not by next layout*, but by **specified in settings** layouts. <br/>
Even selected text switches just between **selected** layouts, though if you liked cycling through, starting from `v1.0.2.9` there is **Cycle Mode**.

### Features

###### How to use:
1. To convert selection hit <kbd>Scroll</kbd> when select text
2. To convert input hit <kbd>Pause<kbd> when typing

###### What it can do:
1. Convert last input to another of selected in settings locales.
2. Convert selected text to another of selected in settings locales.
3. Convert last inputted line to another of selected in settings locales.
